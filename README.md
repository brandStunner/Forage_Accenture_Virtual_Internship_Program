# Forage_Accenture_Virtual_Internship_Program
A social media firm is facing a fortunate problem.
The client has reached a massive scale within recent years and does not have the resources internally to handle it. They are looking for help with the management of their journey into such a large scale.
The data analyst, my job is to perform analysis of sample data sets with visualizations to understand the popularity of different content categories.
The brief carefully it states that the client wanted to see “An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.
As explained in the data model, popularity is quantified by the “Score” given to each reaction type. We therefore need data showing the content ID, category, content type, reaction type, and reaction score.
So, to figure out popularity, we’ll have to add up which content categories have the largest score.
